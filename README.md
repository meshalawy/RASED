# RASED
RASED is a scalable dashboard to interactively monitor and analyze billions of OSM updates worldwide. The goal is to provide the necessary infrastructure that is immensely needed by map analyzers to understand and assess the map quality for anywhere in the world, which is a measure of the query accuracy.


This is ongoing work with more information will be added soon, including how to run and use the system. A hosted version of the system is currently available at [https://rased.cs.umn.edu](https://rased.cs.umn.edu) with more than three years worth of map data from OpenStreetMap.
